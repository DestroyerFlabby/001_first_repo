# Clinic Content Engine — Strategy

## North Star Business Goal
Build a compliant, AI-powered content system that increases brand visibility, trust, and qualified inbound traffic to medical clinics — without adding operational burden.

This applies to:
- Medical consultancies
- Aesthetic / injectables clinics
- Plastic surgery clinics
- Dermatology and similar medical aesthetics

## Product Definition
A config-driven content engine that transforms clinic-approved inputs into:
- Social posts (caption + hashtags + CTA + disclaimers)
- Optional short-form video scripts (30–60s)

Clinics never touch AI tools directly. We deliver approval-ready drafts.

## Core Value Proposition
1) Consistency without internal content burden
2) Trust through education and clarity
3) Compliance-aware messaging
4) Increased qualified inbound traffic over time

We are NOT selling AI content.
We are selling a compliant content system.

## Two Profile Strategy

### Profile A — Medical Consultancy
- Platforms: LinkedIn + light Instagram
- Tone: professional, calm, trust-building
- Focus: process clarity, myths vs facts, common mistakes, reassurance
- CTA: “learn more,” “book consultation,” “message us”

### Profile B — Aesthetics / Plastic / Injectables
- Platforms: Instagram (+ optional TikTok scripts)
- Tone: modern, confident, medically grounded
- Focus: what to expect, safety, aftercare, myth correction
- CTA: “explore treatments,” “book consultation,” “DM us”

Same pipeline. Different configs + guardrails.

## Non-Negotiable Principles
- Grounded in clinic-approved sources
- No exaggerated claims
- No outcome guarantees
- Educational tone first
- Minimal operational burden
- Audit trail for transparency
- Keep v1 simple and shippable

## Compliance Guardrails
Avoid:
- “Guaranteed”
- “Risk-free”
- “Permanent”
- “No downtime”
- “Best in Toronto/GTA”
- Dramatic transformation language
- Diagnosis or personalized treatment advice

Default stance:
- Conservative
- Balanced
- Educational
- Include disclaimers where required

## Funnel Logic
We do not promise virality or guaranteed leads.

Traffic is driven by:
- Awareness (education + myths)
- Consideration (expectations + safety)
- Conversion (soft CTAs + clarity)

Success signals:
- Increased profile visits
- Increased website clicks
- Increased consultation inquiries
- Increased saves/shares

## v1 Scope (Must Have)
- Ingest clinic text sources
- Plan monthly content
- Generate posts + scripts
- Enforce guardrails
- Export deliverables (posts.csv, scripts, audit_log)
- Run in stub mode without API key

## v1 Exclusions
- No UI/dashboard
- No automated posting
- No paid ads
- No agent frameworks
- No complex vector DB yet
- No AI avatars

## v2+ Roadmap
1) Embeddings retrieval
2) Voice-note ingestion
3) Video clipping + caption automation
4) Performance feedback loop
5) Multi-client orchestration + cloud deployment
